Each column is called a 'slot'.
The 4 stacks of cards are called 'stacks'.
The three cards at the top are your 'hand'.
- You can move the top card from your hand to a slot by simply by typing the slot number.    
- Press enter with no command to cycle the hand from the deck.
- Move cards from one slot to another by using 'slot <from slot #> <to slot #>'.
- Move the top card of your hand or a slot to a stack by using 'stack <from slot # / hand>'. 

If you run into any problems, open an issue.
